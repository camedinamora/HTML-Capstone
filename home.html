        <h3>Bigote and Ruth's story:</h3>
    </smallHeader>
    <bodyText>
        <h4>Bigote Downey was born in December in Mexico City, in a construction site close to Museo Papalote.
             Orphaned at a young age, he was rescued alongside his twin brother, Lucas, by a local woman. Bigote,
            originally named Benito, was subsequently adopted by Camila and Matthew, who brought him to their apartment
            in Colonia Roma. Around six months later, Camila was made aware of a kitten who had made her way
             into their building's garage. After much effort, Camila rescued the kitten and brought her up to the apartment.
              Camila and Matthew named the kitten Ruth Bader Ginsburg Downey, after the late Supreme Court Justice,
              affectionally known as Little Cat. Ruth and Bigote became fast friends, and later moved to North Carolina.
              Two years later, they undertook the long journey to California, driving over 50 hours to San Francisco,
              where they presently reside. Although Ruth and Bigote fight more than they did when Ruth was a baby,
               they do love each other. Together with their parents, they will soon relocate once again, this time to the Big Apple.   </h6>
